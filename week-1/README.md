# Preparation

There are several steps you need to take before using this tutorial.

1. Fork the tutorials repository to your personal github account.
   Make sure your forked repository visibility is set to public so
   that the teacher can check your progress. If you forget how to,
   you can recheck last assigment on forking a repository here:
   https://github.com/Edusteam-Kharisma-Bangsa/11-oxford-git-tutorial

2. Clone the repository to your device. For this one you need to be
   familiar with the terminal.
